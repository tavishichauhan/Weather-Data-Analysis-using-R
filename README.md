# Weather Data Analysis using R (2020â€“2025) ðŸŒ¤ðŸ“Š

This project presents a comparative weather data analysis for three Indian cities â€” *Shimla, **Srinagar, and **Pune* â€” using historical weather data from *2020 to 2025, completed as part of the *"Statistics with R" course in my 2nd semester at PGDAV College, University of Delhi.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Fetch daily weather data (Max/Min Temperature & Precipitation)
- Perform year-wise statistical summaries (Mean, Median, Variance)
- Visualize trends and compare climate patterns across cities
- Interpret regional weather differences based on geography

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- *Language:* R
- *Libraries:* httr, jsonlite, ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate
- *Data Source:* [Open-Meteo Archive API](https://open-meteo.com/)

## ðŸ—ƒ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| data_collection.R | R script to fetch data using Open-Meteo API |
| summary_statistics.R | Computes mean, median, variance per year & city |
| data_visualization.R | ggplot2 visualizations for temperature & precipitation |
| Weather_Data_Analysis_Report.pdf | Full project report with interpretations |
| Shimla_weather.xlsx | Cleaned daily weather data for Shimla (2020â€“2025) |

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- *Pune* has higher and more stable temperatures due to its tropical lowland climate.
- *Shimla* and *Srinagar* show cooler and more variable climates, typical of hill stations.
- *Srinagar* has the highest variance, reflecting extreme winters and warm summers.
- Rainfall patterns differ â€” Pune's rain is monsoon-heavy, while Shimla & Srinagar see spread-out precipitation.
